# Install role dependencies. This script is meant to be used in the context of
# ansible-skeleton[1] and ansible-role-skeleton[2].
#
# This script will search ansible/site.yml (or the specified playbook) for
# roles assigned to hosts in the form "user.role". It will then try to install
# them all. If possible, it will use Ansible Galaxy (on Linux, MacOS), but if
# this is not available (e.g. on Windows), it will use Git to clone the latest
# revision.
#
# Remark that this is a very crude technique and especially the Git fallback
# is very brittle. It will download HEAD, and not necessarily the latest
# release of the role. Additionally, the name of the repository is guessed,
# but if it does not exist, the script will fail.
#
# Using ansible-galaxy and a dependencies.yml file is the best method, but
# unavailable on Windows. This script is an effort to have a working
# alternative.
